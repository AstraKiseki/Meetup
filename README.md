# Origin Code Academy "Learn to Code" Meetup

This repository contains the resources you'll need if you've decided to follow along with the projects at our monthly meetups.

Currently there's a **Projects** folder and a **Meetups** folder. 

## Projects
At our meetups we'll give out a project that you can complete in your spare time to help you learn how to code.  Folders within this folder will contain a **README.md** file (like this one) with the specifications/requirements of the project, and any materials/resources that you'll need to get that project off the ground.

## Meetups
Every meetup we've done will be summarized in this folder, including any **HFW**s (High Frequency Words) that were identified and notes about the meetup in general.

If you get stuck with a project, you should **Search**, then **Ask**, then **Post**.

**Search**: Look for the answer yourself first. A valuable skill for a software developer to have is to be self-starting. Search for your problem on Google and you'll more than likely find some kind of article/blog post/answer on Stack Overflow that will help you out.

**Ask**: If you've been to a meetup, then you should have also been invited to our #meetup channel in Slack. Everybody in that channel should be working on the same project as you, plus we'll be in there ourselves from time to time to help you out.

**Post**: If you've searched high and low for the answer, and nobody you know can help you with the problem you're having - it's time to turn to the internet. Stack Overflow is a great place to ask almost 1,000,000 programmers what the solution is to the problem you're having. If somebody gives you the solution, it's also a great opportunity to write a blog post explaining in detail the problem you had and a matching solution. That way, anybody else that searches for the same problem you had can easily find the answer.


Now, get coding! :-)

Cheers,
