# Origin Code Academy "Learn to Code" Meetup

This repository contains the resources you'll need if you've decided to follow along with the projects at our monthly meetups.

Currently there's a **Projects** folder and a **Meetups** folder. 

## Projects
At our meetups we'll give out a project that you can complete in your spare time to help you learn how to code.  Folders within this folder will contain a **README.md** file (like this one) with the specifications/requirements of the project, and any materials/resources that you'll need to get that project off the ground.

## Meetups
Every meetup we've done will be summarized in this folder, including any **HFW**s (High Frequency Words) that were identified and notes about the meetup in general.

If you get stuck with a project, you can either **Search**,**Ask** or **Post**. (Preferably in that order!) If you've been to a meetup, then you should have also been invited to our #meetup channel in Slack - feel free to ask your fellow future programmers for help!

Cheers,
