# TicTacToe
Our first assignment at the meetup will be to build a simple game of Tic Tac Toe using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## Description
You have been tasked with building the timeless game of Tic Tac Toe. The rules of this turn-based game are simple.

* There are two players (X and O)
* X always goes first.
* Players alternate placing their X or O in a slot on the board until one of the following happens:
	* Win! Either player has successfully managed to get three Xs or Os in a row **diagonally**, **vertically** or **horizontally**.
	* Draw! All 9 slots on the board have been taken, and neither player has been able to get three Xs or Os in a row.

## Scope
* The board will be 3x3 slots (A total of 9 slots)
* Each player will be human-based (We will move on to AI in the second part of this project)

## Requirements
* The game must be built using **HTML** and **Javascript**, and optionally styled using **CSS**.
* The game must be automatic. After a player places their X or O on the board, the other player should be able to take their turn straightaway.
* The game must be able to detect when a "Win!" has happened.
* The game must be able to detect when a "Draw!" has happened.
* There must be a button that "resets" the board at any time.

## High Level Tasks
* [ ] Create a GitHub repository called TicTacToe in your account
* [ ] Clone this repository to your local machine
* [ ] Build the game on your local machine
* [ ] Commit and push your game back up to GitHub

## Helpful Hints
* You can use a [two dimensional array](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/966225/how-can-i-create-a-two-dimensional-array-in-javascript) as the data structure for your board.
* You can use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) in your project to simplify DOM manipulation and add more *pazazz* to your game. 

## Learning Goals
By the end of this project, you'll have learned: 

* How to create a GitHub repository and store your work there.
* How to turn a set of requirements into an application.
* How to use HTML/CSS/JS to build simple games.
* How to **Search**, **Ask** and **Post** when you get stuck.
* That tic-tac-toe is fun and addictive!
